# fz-typespam
A simple text spam script for Flipper Zero, written in JavaScript.
**This was written and tested using *Momentum Firmware*. This script may not be compatible with other firmwares.**

Before running, be sure you are focused on the text box you want to type into!

- ## 1: Input how many times you want it to type

- ## 2: Input the text to type

- ## 3: Wait

### I do NOT condone this script to be used in any way that may be malicious, may cause damage, or break ToS somewhere. This was created for experimentation and education and it should solely be used for these purposes.
